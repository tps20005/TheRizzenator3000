# TheRizzenator3000
Get Rizzed up with The Rizzenator 3000, a free online generator of pick up lines to swoon your crush. 

This project came to be by participating in the Brainrot Hackathon 2024 hosted by Audrey Chen (@/jia.seed). 

# INSPIRATION:
Our inspiration for ‘The Rizzenator 3000’ was reminiscing about the show, “Phineas and Ferb” and reflecting on our social anxiety. Thus, we wanted to find a way where we can create a fun and modern way for people to approach others, specifically people they have a crush on. With inspiration from Dr. Doof’s ability to name his inventions with ‘-nator’, ‘The Rizzenator 3000’ was born! 

# WHAT IT DOES:
‘The Rizzenator 3000’ generates different pick up lines when the user clicks on the “Get Rizz Now” button. As the user clicks the button, different pick up lines will appear. Also, a subway surfer game play starts playing so that the user is able to focus while going through the different pick up lines. 

# HOW WE BUILT IT:


# CHALLENGES:
Security Issues: original extension used (great-site.net) on the website would be blocked by our Wifi providers as it was deemed “insecure”. 
Lack of experience: We are both fairly new to using HTML, CSS and Javascript, thus implementing our ideas was a bit of a learning curve. 
Unfamiliarity to Brainrot: Although we encounter brain rot through doomscrolling on social media, we don’t typically use brain rot terms in real life. Thus, implementing brain rot into our project didn’t come to us easily. 

# ACCOMPLISHMENT 
Implementation of Brainrot: using references and memes seen in social media into project 
Website Building: being able to create and release a website within a short time frame and with limited experience 

# WHAT WE LEARNED
Improvement in the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
Research: Being able to effectively research in a topic we’re unfamiliar with (brain rot) in order to portray it in an authentic manner 
Patience: Through the challenges we’ve faced throughout the project, we were able to be level headed and continue to perservere 

# What's next for The Rizzemetor 3000? 
AI Chat Bot: Implement an AI chat feature so that users are able to roleplay what they would say to their crush in order to prevent embarrassing encounters 
Pick up Line Post: Implement a feature where users are able to submit pick up lines to website
